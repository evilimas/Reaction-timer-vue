## Reaction Timer Project

# -- My First Vue Project --

The Reaction Timer Project is a simple web application **built with Vue.js using the Options API**. It measures your reaction time by presenting a block that appears after a random delay, and your task is to click on the block as quickly as possible. After clicking, the application displays your reaction time in milliseconds and provides you with a rank based on your performance.

### How to Play

1. **Press Play Button:** Start the game by clicking the "Press Play" button.
2. **Wait for the Block:** Wait for the green block to appear on the screen.
3. **Click as Quickly as Possible:** Once the block appears, click on it as fast as you can!
4. **View Results:** Your reaction time in milliseconds will be displayed, along with a rank based on your performance.
